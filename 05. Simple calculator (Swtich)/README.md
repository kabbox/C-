# Simple Calculator (Switch)

This project is a simple calculator program written in C++ that demonstrates the use of the `switch` statement to perform basic arithmetic operations. The program allows the user to add, subtract, multiply, divide, or find the remainder of two numbers.

## What is included in this program?

- User is prompted to enter two numbers (integers).
- User is prompted to enter an operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or `%`.
- The program uses a `switch` statement to determine which operation to perform based on the operator entered.
- The result of the operation is displayed to the user.
- If the user enters an invalid operator, an error message is shown.

## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulus (remainder) operations.
- Input validation for operator selection.
- Clear and user-friendly output messages.

## Example Usage

```
Simple Calculator
Enter First Number: 10
Enter Second Number: 5
Enter the Operator (+, -, *, /, %): *
Product: 50
```

## How it works

1. The program starts and displays a welcome message.
2. The user enters two integer values.
3. The user enters an operator.
4. The program performs the selected operation using a `switch` statement.
5. The result is displayed. If the operator is invalid, an error message is shown.

## Purpose

This program is designed for beginners to practice:

- Using the `switch` statement in C++
- Handling user input and output
- Performing basic arithmetic operations
