# Calculate Area of Rectangle, Circle, Triangle

This project contains a C++ program that allows the user to calculate the area of a rectangle, circle, or triangle based on their selection.

## How it Works

- The program displays a menu for the user to choose which shape's area to calculate.
- Based on the user's choice, it prompts for the required dimensions (base, height, or radius).
- It then calculates and displays the area for the selected shape.
- If the user enters an invalid option, an error message is shown.

## Usage

1. Open `code.cpp` to view or edit the source code.
2. Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. Select the shape by entering 1 (Rectangle), 2 (Circle), or 3 (Triangle).
4. Enter the required dimensions when prompted.
5. The program will display the calculated area.

## Example Output

```
Enter your desire number to calculate...
 1.Rectangle
 2.Circle
 3.Triangle

1
Enter The Base : 5
Enter The Height : 10
Your Rectangle Area is : 50
```

## Purpose

This program is a basic exercise for beginners to practice using switch statements, user input, and arithmetic operations in C++.
